// Root Selectors
// Feature selectors will be added here as we build features

// Imports will be used as features are added:
// import { createSelector } from '@ngrx/store';
// import { AppState } from './app.state';

// Example of how to create feature selectors:
// export const selectDashboardState = (state: AppState) => state.dashboard;

// Placeholder export to prevent empty file
export const APP_SELECTORS_PLACEHOLDER = true;
